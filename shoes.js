The yeezy 350 boost v2 features several outer changes, such as differnt pattern, removed heel tab, and a large stripe running around the outer side of the shoe with words "SPLY-350". The sole also has been updated to be transparent and features full-length visibility of the boost material midsole through a grid-pattern opening on the outsole. The shoes are really comfortable coming from numeral sources. The one main bad thing about the shoe is that it can get dirty reall quick if not taking care of properley. The yeezy cream whites can get dirty if running or exercising on grass or dirt. kanye West brought adidas to a whole new level when he realesed the Adidas Yeezy 350 Boost V2.

They are called the flu games because Michael Jordan played while having flu like symptoms. The story is that Jordan ordered pizza to his hotel room a day before game 5. He had called his personal trainer to his hotle room where he was in the fetal position sweating non-stop. He couldn't even sit up in bed and he was diagnosed with food poisining likely caused by the pizza that he had ate. The team's trainers told Michael Jordan that he couldn't play game 5, but the team needed him and he knew it too. The Utah Jazz had won the previous two games which tied the series at 2-2. One more win and the Utah Jazz could have taken the lead in the series. Jordan was not going to let that happen, so he ended up playing and scored an incredible 38 points and put his team in the lead of the series which they ended up winning. At any point in the game, Michael Jordan could have fainted and passed out. The Chicago Bulls beat the Utah Jazz in the 1997 NBA Finals. The Jordan Flu Game 12s were auctioned which started at a price of 5,000 and ended at a price of 104,000. Record says that the Jordan 12 Flu Games are the most expensive shoes ever sold(auctioned).</p> Pros: <ol> <li> Great price for Jordan 12s at 150-200 considering original price for Jordan 12s were around 400 dolars.</li> <li>It uses nike air technology through the whole sole. </li> <li> It is a high top shoe so it supports your ankle really good.</li> </ol> Cons: <ol> <li> A lot of people hated the remake of the Jordan 12 Flu Games because it didn't use leather and it didn't look like the original Jordan 12 Flu Games. </li> <li> The Jordan 12 Flu Games use leather, so many animals are killed and skinned for the fabric of the shoes. </li> </ol>"

The Nike Hypervenom is good for traction and agility, designed for deceptive players. In May 2013, the Nike Hypervenom Phantom was launched. It was launched and designed by Brazilian forward Neymar. The launch of the colorway was black/bright citrus. All Nike Hypervenoms were made in firm fround and soft ground varieties, with sof ground using removable studs. The Nike Hypervenom Phantom features a NikeSkin upper, combining mesh webbing and thin layers of polyurethane to create a material that is soft and flexible. The upper also features a lightweight, perforated anatomical sockliner for low-profile cushoning and has a responsive glass nylon chassis with agility traction stud pattern for agility, comfort, and durability. In the 2014 World Cup Nike introduced new colorways for their Nike Hypervenoms which many great soccer players wore. During the 2014 World Cup, Neymar scored the 100th goal of the World Cup Tournament. Nike commemorated this with a special edition pair of Gold/Volt/Black Hypervenom boots. This was also made because Neymar spray painted his soccer cleats when he was 12 years old. The Nike Hypervenoms have All Conditions Control (ACC), which means that the boot can handle any condition, weather it is wet or dry. </p> Pros: <ol> <li> The Nike Hypervenom uses ACC which means that it has good material that could hold up in any condition of weather. </li> <li> Many great soccer players use nike hypervenoms like Robert Lewandowski, Harry Kane, and especially the one that indorsed the shoe, Neymar making the shoe a popular soccer cleat for forwards. </li> <li> Just like any other cleats, the nike hypervenoms have many differnt cleat styles like artifical ground, firm ground, and soft ground. The artificial ground contains many circular and hollow studs, meant to have more pressure distribution and trapping air to reduce impact and prevent injuries. </li> </ol> Cons: <ol>  <li> The hypervenom X final model lack All-Condition Control. It does not use ACC like the first models of hypervenoms. </li> <li> Due to complaints about the new upper on the new nike hypervenoms, Nike opted to change the upper to the original nike hypervenoms. </li> </ol>   ";
