 <h1> What is Vindinium</h1>
 <img height="250" src="http://i.imgur.com/8NlAaFv.png">
<p> This is my vindinium Website. Here I will be explaining what
vindinium is. Vindinium is an intelligence programming challenge
game in which you have control of your bot and you have to battle
other AI bots. Each bot has a specific amount of turns and the bot
with the most gold by the end of the game wins. The bots are trying
to control the gold mines and when a bot's health gets low, that bot
goes to buy cream soda from a tavern and the process repeats over and over
agian. Bots might also
crash in the game. There is also a leaderboard which shows which
players are on the top of the game.
</p>
<h1> Deciding What-Decide if Mines-Taverns-Attacking</h1>
<p> A tavern is basically a place where a bot will go if their
health is low. A bot can buy cream soda from a tavern for gold. The
cream soda will restore a bot's health.
The bot will automatically go to the tavern because if another
bot has higher health then the bot will definetly not fight that
bot.</p>

<img src="tavern.png">
 I set up my code so that when my bot has lower than 50 health it
 will go to the a tavern to restore its health. I decided to do this so that
 my bot would'nt die and so that my bot wins the game.

 <p> The mines are the gold in the carts. Each bot is trying to 
 collect as much goldmines as they can. They are also trying to take
 other players goldmines while defending theirs. The objective is
 to end up with the most gold by the end of the game.</p>
 <img src=" Goldmines.png">
 <p> This is my code for my bot to go to the goldmines. I put it so
 that my bot would go to the goldmines when his health is higher
 than 50. I decided to do this so that my bot would'nt die
 because if my bot goes to a goldmine when he has lower than 50 health
 he might die if another bot is there with higher health.</p>

 <h1> AI Bot</h1>
 <img height="250" src="http://stratosprovatopoulos.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screenshot.png"
 <p> An AI bot is basically a bot that is controlled by you. AI mean
 artificial inteligence. A bot's main objective is to get gold
 from the gold mines while being attacked by other bots. Your bot
 can also attack other bots. when your bot's health is too low
 your bot will go to a tavern to buy cream soda for gold so that
 it can regain health and continue to get gold. The bot with the
 most gold collected by the end of the game wins the game. You
 can also make your bot better by adding comments. Comments basically
 tell your bot what to do. For example, you can put set mydir to go
 to taverns when health is lower than 50. That will make it so that
 your bot will go to a tavern when its health is lower than 50 so
 that it won't die from another bot. I decided to do this so that
 my bot would'nt die if there was another bot nearby ready to kill
 my bot, because if I get more health then I would have a better
 chance to survive and kill the other bot in a battle</p>
 
 
 
  <h1> What I Learned</h1>
  
 <img height="250" src="http://secretengineer.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/whatIlearned31.png">
 <p> This has been an interesting process of computer science. There
 has been some ups and some downs but I think overall I have learned
 a lot in this class about computer science. I learned a lot about
 this game. Vindinium is a good game that shows how well you made
 your bot by adding a good amount of comments. I learned how to make
 a bot and make it attack other players and make it get goldmines
 in order for me to win. I remembered the first time my bot played
 in a game it won and I felt good when it won. Then the next game
 it got destroyed by Mauri's bot lol. Mauri's bot got like 1,500 and
 something score and mine only got like 150. That was when I was 
 barely starting to play and I was still learing how to make my bot
 better. I haven't battled since, but I think my bot will put up a
 good match with the other bots. I also learned how to add comments
 to make my bot better in the game.</p>
